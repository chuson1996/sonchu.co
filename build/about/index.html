    <h2>So you want to get to know me better</h2>
<p>My dad used to call me the monk who likes everything. I'm not sure why he called me a monk, maybe at that time I didn't have any hair, but it's true, my interests are probably way too many.</p>
<p>üèÄ I love basketball, and the fact that I'm born a small kid, makes me want to train harder to win the games.</p>
<p>üë®‚Äçüíª I started coding when I was in 6th grade and I wasn't too passionate about it since it was somewhat my parent's decision to make me study. But since college, it grew in me as I realized I could use it to make software to solve my own problem.</p>
<p>In 2018, I got my 1st official job as a frontend engineer $50k a year in <a href="https://zalando.fi/">Zalando</a>. The place was awesome, great workplace, great colleagues, great salary for a student I was. However, something else started to grow in me.</p>
<h3>I became obsessed with eCommerce, marketing and branding.</h3>
<p>With my cofounder, we built a sustainable sneaker brand from nothing and in 2019, we bootstrapped it with a Kickstarter, and well...</p>

<p>and within a few years, we launched another campaign:</p>

<p>I've learned so much along the way, faced so many &quot;impossibilities&quot;, and challenged many status quos (&quot;You're a tech nerd&quot;, &quot;You don't have startup experience&quot;, &quot;You don't have a degree&quot;, and the best of all, &quot;you're too young&quot;). To be honest, I enjoy those skepticisms because they fuel my drive to prove them wrong.</p>
<p>I love building startups, I love creating, and hopefully one day I can inspire those who walk this path behind me.</p>
