## So you want to get to know me better

My dad used to call me the monk who likes everything. I'm not sure why he called me a monk, maybe at that time I didn't have any hair, but it's true, my interests are probably way too many.

üèÄ I love basketball, and the fact that I'm born a small kid, makes me want to train harder to win the games.

üë®‚Äçüíª I started coding when I was in 6th grade and I wasn't too passionate about it since it was somewhat my parent's decision to make me study. But since college, it grew in me as I realized I could use it to make software to solve my own problem.

In 2018, I got my 1st official job as a frontend engineer $50k a year in [Zalando](https://zalando.fi/). The place was awesome, great workplace, great colleagues, great salary for a student I was. However, something else started to grow in me.

### I became obsessed with eCommerce, marketing and branding.

With my cofounder, we built a sustainable sneaker brand from nothing and in 2019, we bootstrapped it with a Kickstarter, and well...

and within a few years, we launched another campaign:

I've learned so much along the way, faced so many "impossibilities", and challenged many status quos ("You're a tech nerd", "You don't have startup experience", "You don't have a degree", and the best of all, "you're too young"). To be honest, I enjoy those skepticisms because they fuel my drive to prove them wrong.

I love building startups, I love creating, and hopefully one day I can inspire those who walk this path behind me.
